# ChatGPT API Setup Guide

## 🚀 Your Horizon AI Assistant is now powered by ChatGPT!

### ✅ What Was Removed:
- All Hugging Face transformers code
- Heavy ML dependencies
- Complex tokenization systems
- Memory-intensive models

### ✅ What Was Added:
- ChatGPT API integration using OpenAI's API
- Intelligent fallback responses when API is unavailable
- Personality-aware prompts for ChatGPT
- Clean, fast, and reliable architecture

## 🔑 Setting Up Your OpenAI API Key

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)
1. Copy the template file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` file and add your actual API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
   ```

3. Source the environment (or restart terminal):
   ```bash
   source .env
   ```

### Option 2: Direct Configuration
1. Edit `config.py` file
2. Replace `"your-openai-api-key-here"` with your actual API key:
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
   ```

## 🎯 Getting Your OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI API Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)
5. Add it to your configuration

## 💰 API Costs (Very Affordable!)

- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.0015 per 1K tokens (very cheap!)
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens (more expensive but higher quality)
- For casual use: Expect $1-5 per month
- The app is configured to use GPT-3.5-turbo by default

## 🌟 Features

### When API Key is Available:
- **Real ChatGPT responses** with personality adaptation
- **Intelligent conversation** that understands context
- **Up-to-date knowledge** from OpenAI's training

### When API Key is NOT Available:
- **Smart fallback responses** with topic detection
- **Personality system** still works
- **All basic features** (time, date, math, jokes) work
- **No errors or crashes** - seamless experience

## 🧪 Test Commands

Try these to test your setup:
- **General AI**: "Explain artificial intelligence"
- **Programming**: "How do I learn Python?"
- **Science**: "What is quantum physics?"
- **Creative**: "Write a short poem about technology"
- **Math**: "What is 15 * 24?"
- **Time**: "What time is it?"

## 🔧 Configuration Options

In `app.py`, you can modify:
- **Model**: Change `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` to `"gpt-4"` for better responses
- **Max tokens**: Adjust response length (currently 150)
- **Temperature**: Control creativity (0.1 = focused, 0.9 = creative)

## 📝 Current Status

✅ **Horizon AI Assistant is running successfully**
✅ **All Hugging Face code removed**
✅ **ChatGPT integration ready**
✅ **Smart fallback system active**
✅ **No external ML dependencies**

Your AI assistant will work perfectly even without an API key - it just uses the smart fallback responses instead of ChatGPT.
