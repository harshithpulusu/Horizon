# ðŸš€ Day 4: Media Generation & Memory Extraction

## Objective
Transform Horizon into a complete MCP agent by:
1. Extracting Media Generation functions from the 19,150-line `app.py` 
2. Extracting Memory System functions from `app.py`
3. Enhancing the MCP server with production-ready capabilities
4. Creating agent-ready deployment infrastructure

## Tasks

### âœ… Task 1: Enhanced Media Generation Extraction (3-4 hours)
- [x] Analyze existing media functions in `app.py`
- [x] Extract and enhance `generate_3d_model` function
- [x] Extract and enhance `generate_logo_design` function  
- [x] Extract and enhance `generate_image_api` route logic
- [x] Add video, audio, and GIF generation capabilities
- [x] Create `MediaGenerator` class with unified interface
- [x] Add media format validation and optimization
- [x] Add batch processing capabilities
- [x] Add media metadata handling

### âœ… Task 2: Enhanced Memory System Extraction (2-3 hours)
- [x] Analyze existing memory functions in `app.py`
- [x] Extract `save_user_memory` and `retrieve_user_memory` functions
- [x] Extract `build_conversation_context` and `summarize_conversation_context`
- [x] Extract `extract_learning_patterns` and `update_ai_learning`
- [x] Extract `save_conversation` functionality
- [x] Create `MemoryManager` class with advanced features
- [x] Add memory compression and cleanup
