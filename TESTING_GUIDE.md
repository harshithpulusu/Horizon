# 🎯 Testing Your Enhanced Horizon AI Assistant

## Quick Start Testing Guide

### 1. Open the App
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
- Allow microphone access when prompted

### 2. Test Basic Voice Recognition
1. Click "🎤 Start Listening"
2. Say: "What time is it?"
3. Should respond with current time

### 3. Test Wake Word Detection 🌟
1. Enable "🌟 Always Listening Mode" checkbox
2. Wait for status to show "👂 Listening for 'Hey Horizon'..."
3. Say: "Hey Horizon" (wait for response)
4. Then say: "Tell me a joke"
5. The assistant should respond without you clicking anything!

### 4. Test Weather API 🌤️

#### Without API Key (Mock Data):
- Say: "What's the weather?"
- Should get simulated weather with API setup reminder

#### With API Key (Real Data):
1. Get your free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Add it to `config.py`
3. Restart the app
4. Say: "What's the weather in Paris?"
5. Should get real weather data!

### 5. Test Wake Word + Weather Combo
1. Make sure "Always Listening Mode" is enabled
2. Say: "Hey Horizon, what's the weather in Tokyo?"
3. Should activate and give you real weather data!

## All Wake Word Phrases to Try:
- "Hey Horizon"
- "Horizon"
- "Hey Assistant"  
- "Assistant"

## Weather Commands to Test:
- "What's the weather?"
- "Weather in [city name]"
- "How's the weather in London, UK?"
- "Is it raining in Seattle?"
- "What's the temperature in Miami?"

## Expected Behavior:

### ✅ Wake Word Mode ON:
- Status shows: "👂 Listening for 'Hey Horizon'..."
- Say wake word → Status changes to "🌟 Wake word detected! Listening..."
- Give command → AI responds
- After response → Automatically returns to listening for wake word

### ✅ Weather with API Key:
- Real temperature, conditions, humidity
- Weather emoji (☀️ 🌧️ ❄️ etc.)
- Location-specific data

### ✅ Weather without API Key:
- Mock data with helpful setup message
- Still functional for testing

## Troubleshooting:

**🔴 Wake word not working:**
- Check microphone permissions
- Try speaking more clearly
- Ensure you're on HTTPS or localhost
- Check browser console for errors

**🔴 Weather not working:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key in config.py
- Restart app after config changes
- Try different city names

**🔴 Speech recognition issues:**
- Use Chrome or Safari (best support)
- Check microphone is working
- Speak clearly and not too fast
- Reduce background noise

## Advanced Testing:

### Personality Changes:
Try changing personality and testing weather:
- Friendly: "What's the weather?" (cheerful response)
- Professional: "Weather report" (business-like)
- Enthusiastic: "How's the weather?" (excited response)
- Witty: "What's Mother Nature up to?" (humorous)

### Context Awareness:
1. Ask: "What's the weather in Paris?"
2. Follow up: "How about London?" (should understand context)

### Multi-City Testing:
- "Weather in New York"
- "How about Tokyo?"
- "What about London, UK?"

## 🎉 Success Indicators:

You know it's working when:
- ✅ Wake word activates without clicking
- ✅ Real weather data appears (with API key)
- ✅ Different personalities give different responses
- ✅ Status indicators update correctly
- ✅ App works hands-free with wake words

2. Speak naturally - don't over-articulate
3. Wait for the status to show "Ready" before giving the next command
4. Use the weather API - it makes a huge difference!
