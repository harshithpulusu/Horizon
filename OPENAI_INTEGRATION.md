# Horizon AI Assistant - Now with OpenAI Integration! ðŸš€

## What's New?

I've integrated **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo** into your Horizon AI Assistant! Now it can answer ANY question, not just the predefined skills.

## How It Works

1. **Built-in Skills First**: For common requests like "What time is it?", "Set timer for 5 minutes", "Tell me a joke", the AI uses its built-in skills for fast responses.

2. **OpenAI Fallback**: For everything else (general questions, complex queries, conversations), it uses OpenAI's powerful language model to provide intelligent responses.

## Quick Commands That Work

âœ… **Time & Date**
- "What time is it?"
- "What's today's date?"

âœ… **Timers**
- "Set timer for 5 minutes"
- "Set timer for 30 seconds"

âœ… **Math**
- "Calculate 25 times 4"
- "What's 100 divided by 5?"

âœ… **Jokes**
- "Tell me a joke"
- "Make me laugh"

âœ… **General Questions** (via OpenAI)
- "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?"
- "What is the capital of France?"
- "Explain quantum physics"
- "How do I bake a cake?"

## Setting Up OpenAI (Optional but Recommended)

To unlock the full power of the AI assistant:

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-openai-api-key"
```

### Option 2: Direct Code Edit
Edit `app.py` and replace `"your-openai-api-key-here"` with your actual API key.

### Getting an OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy and use it in the assistant

## Without OpenAI Key

Even without an OpenAI key, the assistant still works great with:
- Time and date queries
- Timer and reminder functions
- Math calculations  
- Jokes and trivia
- All the quick commands

It will show a friendly message explaining how to unlock full capabilities.

## Personality System
