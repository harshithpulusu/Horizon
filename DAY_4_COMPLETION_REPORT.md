  - `LogoGenerator` - Professional logo design generation
  - `Enhanced3DModelGenerator` - 3D model creation with multiple API support
  - `EnhancedMediaEngine` - Unified media generation interface
- **Added** support for Tripo API, Meshy API, and enhanced image generation
- **Implemented** batch processing capabilities for media generation

### 2. Enhanced Memory System & Extraction (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Extracted** memory and learning functions from `app.py`
- **Enhanced** `core/memory_system.py` with database integration:

  - `EnhancedMemorySystem` - Advanced pattern analysis and prediction
- **Implemented** user pattern analysis and conversation summarization
- **Added** conversation context building and learning pattern extraction
- **Maintained** full backward compatibility with existing functions

### 3. Production-Ready MCP Agent (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Enhanced** MCP server with 13 tools (up from 8):
  - Original: chat, generate_image, generate_video, generate_audio, analyze_emotion, get_personality, switch_personality, get_memory_stats
  - **New Day 4**: generate_logo, generate_3d_model, batch_generate, analyze_user_patterns, get_conversation_summary
- **Enhanced** MCP resources with 6 resources (up from 3):
  - Original: chat_history, personalities, memory_stats
  - **New Day 4**: user_patterns, generation_capabilities, performance_metrics
- **Implemented** advanced agent workflow management
- **Added** real-time performance monitoring and analytics

### 4. Agent Deployment Infrastructure (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Created** comprehensive deployment system:
  - `scripts/deploy_agent.py` - Production deployment manager
  - `Dockerfile` - Container deployment support
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Multi-service orchestration
  - `horizon-agent.service` - Systemd service configuration
